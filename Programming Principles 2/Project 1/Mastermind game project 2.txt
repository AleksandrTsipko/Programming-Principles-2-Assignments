The program randomly selects a 5-digit secret number from a predefined set of six numbers.
The player inputs a 5-digit guess, and the program provides feedback on the guess using specific response characters:

B: Correct digit in the correct position.
W: Correct digit in an incorrect position.
_: Incorrect digit (not in the secret number).


The game continues until the player guesses the number correctly, runs out of attempts (10), or chooses to quit by entering 'q'.
After winning or losing, the player can choose to play again or exit.
